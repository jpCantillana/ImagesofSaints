<h2>Historical context</h2>
<p>
    The Anjou Legendarium is a Gothic illuminated manuscript of a collection of stories from the life of saints important to the House of Anjou of Hungary. It was made on the occasion of the journey of Charles I of Hungary and his son Prince Andrew to Naples in Italy in 1330.<br />
    The legendarium was a picture book intended for children with a brief text accompanying pictures. The painters of the work came from Bologna and painted in the style of the trecento.<br />
    The medieval Legendarium of more than 140 pages contains images and scenes of the life of Jesus Christ, the Hungarian bishop Saint Gerard Sagredo, the prince Saint Emeric of Hungary, the King Saint Ladislaus I of Hungary, the Polish bishop Stanislaus of Szczepanów, Saint Francis of Assisi, Saint Martin, Saint George and of many other legendary Christians.<br />
    The Trecento is considered to be the beginning of the Italian Renaissance or at least the Proto-Renaissance in art history. The Trecento was also famous as a time of heightened literary activity, with writers working in the vernacular instead of Latin. Dante, Petrarch and Boccaccio were the leading writers of the age. Dante produced his famous La divina commedia (The Divine Comedy), now seen as a summation of the medieval worldview, and Petrarch wrote verse in a lyrical style influenced by the Provençal poetry of the troubadours.<br />

<h2>Thoughts</h2>
<p style="font-size:18px;">
    We can think of the position of the kid, which is not in the passage, maybe making reference to the role of the prince in the scheme of things: between St. Peter and Christ, he serves 
    God in the material world, as a fish provider. The situation in the region the last centuries was confusing: the region had serfs that were roman catholic, orthodox and even muslims in 
    the island of Sicily. The Pope himself was raiding the area during the Hohenstaufen dinasty dominance in the area. The Anjou dinasty took place by helping the Pope and, after the Siciliian Vespers 
    conflict they secured their dominance in the continental portion. St. Peter fishes, the child helps St. Peter and presents his fish to Christ, involving themselves in the chain of power.
