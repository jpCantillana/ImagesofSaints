    Represents a piece of the bible:<br/>
    In the Vulgata: <br />
1 Postea manifestavit se iterum Iesus ad mare Tiberiadis manifestavit autem sic<br/>
2 erant simul Simon Petrus et Thomas qui dicitur Didymus et Nathanahel qui erat a Cana Galilaeae et filii Zebedaei et alii ex discipulis eius duo<br/>
3 dicit eis Simon Petrus vado piscari dicunt ei venimus et nos tecum et exierunt et ascenderunt in navem et illa nocte nihil prendiderunt<br/>
4 mane autem iam facto stetit Iesus in litore non tamen cognoverunt discipuli quia Iesus est<br/>
5 dicit ergo eis Iesus pueri numquid pulmentarium habetis responderunt ei non<br/>
6 dixit eis mittite in dexteram navigii rete et invenietis miserunt ergo et iam non valebant illud trahere a multitudine piscium<br/>
7 dicit ergo discipulus ille quem diligebat Iesus Petro Dominus est Simon Petrus cum audisset quia Dominus est tunicam succinxit se erat enim nudus et misit se in mare<br/>
8 alii autem discipuli navigio venerunt non enim longe erant a terra sed quasi a cubitis ducentis trahentes rete piscium<br/>
9 ut ergo descenderunt in terram viderunt prunas positas et piscem superpositum et panem<br/>
10 dicit eis Iesus adferte de piscibus quos prendidistis nunc<br/>
11 ascendit Simon Petrus et traxit rete in terram plenum magnis piscibus centum quinquaginta tribus et cum tanti essent non est scissum rete<br/>
12 dicit eis Iesus venite prandete et nemo audebat discentium interrogare eum tu quis es scientes quia Dominus esset<br/>
13 et venit Iesus et accepit panem et dat eis et piscem similiter<br/>
14 hoc iam tertio manifestatus est Iesus discipulis cum surrexisset a mortuis<br/><br/>
In the revised catholic:<br />
1 After these things Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias; and he showed himself in this way. <br />
2 Gathered there together were Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin,[a] Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples. <br />
3 Simon Peter said to them, “I am going fishing.” They said to him, “We will go with you.” They went out and got into the boat, but that night they caught nothing.<br />
4 Just after daybreak, Jesus stood on the beach; but the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. <br />
5 Jesus said to them, “Children, you have no fish, have you?” They answered him, “No.” <br />
6 He said to them, “Cast the net to the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in because there were so many fish. <br />
7 That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, “It is the Lord!” When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on some clothes, for he was naked, and jumped into the sea. <br />
8 But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, only about a hundred yards[b] off.<br />
9 When they had gone ashore, they saw a charcoal fire there, with fish on it, and bread. <br />
10 Jesus said to them, “Bring some of the fish that you have just caught.” <br />
11 So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, a hundred fifty-three of them; and though there were so many, the net was not torn. <br />
12 Jesus said to them, “Come and have breakfast.” Now none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?” because they knew it was the Lord. <br />
13 Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish. <br />
14 This was now the third time that Jesus appeared to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.<br /><br />

<h2>Class notes</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Christ is in the shore as a sign of authority. Sea agains land, stability, dryness</li>
        <li>Different sources describe new/different situations, non biblical</li>
        <li>How do we interpret the fire, and all the symbols around?</li>
        <li>Codex Egberti, contrary to the Hungarian Angevine manustripts, is based in the gospel, not the legends</li>
    </ul>
